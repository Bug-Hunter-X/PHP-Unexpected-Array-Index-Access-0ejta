This repository demonstrates an uncommon PHP bug related to unexpected array index access. The `processData` function assumes that each inner array in the input `$data` has at least one element. If this assumption is violated, accessing `$innerArray[0]` will result in an error. The solution involves adding a check to ensure the inner array is not empty before accessing its elements.
